/**
 * consent.ts — the cookie gate, and the only thing on this site that may load Google's
 * script.
 *
 * The model is the same one the rest of the family uses, and it is the same for the same
 * reason. The law that shapes it is the European one, broadly copied now by the United
 * Kingdom, Brazil, Quebec and others: storage that is not strictly necessary for the thing
 * the visitor actually asked for may not be set until they say yes, and saying no has to be
 * as easy as saying yes. Counting somebody as a statistic because they loaded a page is the
 * exact thing the rule was written about.
 *
 * So nothing here is clever:
 *
 *   - **The Google Analytics script is NOT in the page.** It is appended only after a yes,
 *     which means a declined visit makes no request to Google at all and receives no cookie.
 *     Not "cookies disabled" — never loaded. The end-to-end suite asserts both halves: no
 *     consent, no request, `window.gtag` undefined.
 *   - The choice is remembered in localStorage rather than a cookie, because setting a
 *     cookie to record a cookie decision would be its own small joke.
 *   - Accept and Reject are the same size, the same weight and the same distance from the
 *     reader. There is no pre-ticked box and no "manage preferences" maze with the off
 *     switch three screens down.
 *   - Rejecting is a real answer, not a nag: the bar does not return on the next visit.
 *   - The longer answer is a panel, not a maze. Every purpose is named, and the ONE switch
 *     starts off — a box that arrives already ticked is a default, not a choice.
 *
 * WHAT IS DIFFERENT HERE, and it is a difference in the visitor's favour: this site has **no
 * strictly necessary cookie at all**. It has no accounts, it has no server behind it, and
 * nothing about the visitor is stored anywhere — the pictures you show it, the names you
 * type and the model it trains on them live in this tab and in this browser, and the page
 * never sends a byte of any of it anywhere. So this panel names ONE real choice instead of
 * inventing categories to look thorough, and the ask says plainly that your pictures never
 * leave the machine whatever you answer.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS FILE IS PORTED FROM `llm-demo/src/consent.ts`, WHICH IS THE REFERENCE the whole
 * family is brought up from. Port it rather than writing a new one — the door below was
 * once bound instead of delegated, and that one line cost a dead footer button on every
 * React site in the family.
 */

/*
 * ⚠️ THIS FILE IS DELIBERATELY NOT A MODULE, and the page loads it as a classic script
 * (`<script src="./consent.js" defer>`) — so it must contain no top-level `import` and no
 * `export`, or the browser refuses the whole file with "Unexpected token 'export'" and the
 * gate does nothing at all. That is measured, not theory: it is exactly what happened on the
 * first build of this page. The window typings therefore live in `types.ts`, which IS a
 * module, and this file simply uses them.
